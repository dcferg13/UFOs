# UFOs
 Building a dynamic table using data stored in a JavaScript array into a HTML file for viewing.
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage that has an interactive table, so users can find more information about UFO sightings. They now be able to search based on multiple criteria instead of just the date of a sighting.

![ufo_webpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107289345/188020501-d121ede1-11c6-4c9a-b03b-261c01ce04e2.png)

## Results
With this new webpage, you will be able to search the table for information on UFO sightings based on the five search criteria. These include dates, cities, states, countries or the shape of the UFO sighting.  Rather than with the previous webpage that would only allow a search to be based on the date.
For Example
- Search based on on the date

![search_date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107289345/188018418-29a4b219-989c-4f36-81ce-65129bfa7f72.png)

- Search based on the city

![search_city](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107289345/188018452-20984efd-8112-4506-a850-dc0d5471606d.png)

- Search based on a State

- Search based on the Country

- Search based on the shape

- Search based on Date and City

## Summary
In summary, in this new webpage a person is able to search by a specific criteria (ex. date) or search by a multitude of things (ex. date and city). 
One drawback of this new design is that it is designed for a much larger dataset and the UFO dataset that is connected to this html file is based on only on January 2010. The first recommendation for further development would be to include a larger dataset, perhaps the whole year of 2010. The second recommendation would be to add the ‘duration’ of the UFO sighting to the filtered searches.
